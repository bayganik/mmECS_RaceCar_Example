 * Use the object pools to help reduce object instantiation time and performance 
 * with objects that are frequently created and used.
 *
 * You can creat an object pool for multiple "types" of objects (projectiles, enemies, swarms, etc)
 * Then use the singlton for object pool manager
 *  
 * The object pool class is the management structure for individual object pools.  This includes creation of the pool, retrieving objects, 
 * increasing the pool size and also shrinking the pool.  If you have multiple object pools, they should be accessed through the object pool 
 * manager and not the individual pools.
