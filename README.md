# Race Car Example using my managed ECS  (mmECS)
This is a simple and interactive Unity3d example project to show how to use mmECS (Entity Component System).
This (ECS) Framework specifically made for C# and Unity, using unity event manager to register and listen when certain code needs to be executed.

This example aims to demonstrate :

1. Create Components, attach them to Entities (GameObjects)

2. Create Events (to get the systems to communicate)

3. Create Systems (to do all the logic of the game)

## Install for Editor
To Install download mmECS files to a folder.
Go to \mmECS_RaceCar_Example\mmGameLib_UnityEditor
there are 2 files
•51-EntityComponent-NewEntityComponent.cs
•52-EntitySystem-NewEntitySystem.cs

copy to C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Data\Resources\ScriptTemplates and add the two template files
These 2 show up in your editor everytime you want to add a "new" script

Next Restart or Open your Unity project and go to Edit/ProjectSettings/Script Execution Order and Set EntityManager to -200 and Entity to -100.
